            <ol>
                <li>To make the sauce, whisk together the sugar, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, ketchup, soy sauce and garlic into a small bowl.</li>
                <li>Pour enough canola oil into a dutch oven or frying pan that is comes up from the bottom about an inch to an inch and a half.</li>
                <li>Heat the oil on medium high to high heat, you are looking for the chicken to cook and brown in about 2-3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the cornstarch to a large ziplock bag.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken pieces to the large ziplock bag and shake until all the pieces are well coated.</li>
                <li>Dip the pieces into the egg, then into the flour before adding to the hot oil.</li>
                <li>Cook the chicken for 2-3 minutes, until cooked through and crispy.</li>
                <li>Remove to a cookie sheet (no paper towels!) and continue cooking all the chicken pieces.</li>
                <li>When done cooking remove all but a tablespoon of the oil.</li>
                <li>Add the bell peppers, onion and pineapple and cook for 1-2 minutes, until crisp-tender.</li>
                <li>Add the sauce back in and stir to coat the pieces and cook for 30 seconds to help the garlic warm through.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken pieces back in and stir until the sauce has thickened and bubbling.</li>
